# Credit Risk Classification ( End to End Machine Learning Project )

This a personal project I did for learning and understanding how to build machine learning models in a step by step processs. I am a beginner in ML and still learning. So if there are any mistakes it will be very helpful if you point it out.

#### Any type of questions, suggesstions is gladly accespted

## Theme of the project
In banks, providing credit is a tough decision. Analysing the risk regarding the sanction of credit is an important steps. If banks do so, then they could analyse the risk factors so that they slow down or resist providing bad credits.
In this project, we will use German Credit Dataset to figure our if the credit possess risk or not. We will also automate the whole process
